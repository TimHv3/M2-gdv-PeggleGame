# idea 1: gamble peggle
* Multiplier slot machine.
* 3x 7 for a jackpot.
* you shoot a little coin.
* animation for the coin on the side.

# idea 2: Speelland peggle
* the ball is the logo
* You shoot storyline characters from different years
* Your score arent points, but its a fun meter(how happy the kids are)
* You have 5 ingame days (monday to friday) to collect enough points to save speelland from being cancelled
* The more fun you collect beyond the minimum in 5 days, the more groups you fill with children
* Every filled group is a passive multiplier for future tries
* Cannon is Mr Speelland (Timo), or a stormbaan
* Customizable cannon (Mensen van de Hoofdleiding)
* Customizable Targets (Storyline characters from different years)
* Customizable backgrounds (Different area's of the tarrain,like: Speelland gebouw, podiumveld, vloeiveld, minigroep(if possible themed around the specific year that you selected))
* Art style inspiration: zombs royale
* Cannon will be someone throwing the ball (either birds eye view or side view)
* Birds eye view: zombs royale character style
* Side view:
